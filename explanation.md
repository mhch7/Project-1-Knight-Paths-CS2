1. My algortihm looks for different moves a knight can make based on the parameters until the move made is the same as the destination.

2. Some challenges I faced in solving this problem was trying to figure out how to apply the array of different moves a knight can make into the loop, and figuring out how to stop the loop from endlessly repeating through the moves in the array. I was able to get the inputs and prevent the program from crashing right away. However, with the loop to prevent it from endlessly repeating I had to try different conditions. This was happening because the loop wasn't able to get to the destination input.

3. I learned new ways to use arrays and loops and have become more familiar with both concepts and I also feel I have a better grasp of nested loops and foreach loops as well now.
